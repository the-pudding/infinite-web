Because we want to make you believe in the <strong>infinite monkey theorem.</strong>"},{"text":"According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem target=_blank>Wikipedia</a>, “<strong>the infinite monkey theorem</strong> states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.”"},{"text":"“Yeah, right,” you may be thinking. You are not alone. Podcasting mogul Joe Rogan has <em>mostly</em> refused to believe it (though to be fair, he did fixate more on the monkey’s behavior than the concept).","youtube":"joe"},{"text":"In episode 710 he admits, “it could be possible, but I’ve seen no evidence that it has ever been able to be replicated, even in a simple sentence.”"},{"text":"Challenge accepted, Joe. Though we thought it would be more fun to do it with music instead of something that felt like a required school reading."},{"text":"Before we jump back into the tunes, a quick but important math digression. <strong>How likely is the Shakespeare thing, for real?</strong> Even if we just ask a monkey to type Hamlet, without punctuation, the odds are unthinkably small.","hamlet":"true"},{"text":"To begin to understand where this insane number comes from, we bring back Beethoven. How do we calculate the odds of just getting the first two notes (G, G) correct from just two keys?","odds":"true"},{"text":"As we play additional notes, the chances of success become more slim. Here is that same thing, visually, with all four notes.","graphic":"probability","type":"note"},{"text":"You get the picture. <strong>The number of possibilities goes up exponentially with each new note</strong>. Shakespeare will effectively take “forever,” but if we did have forever, it would (almost surely) happen!"},{"text":"While the probability kept shrinking for the Beethoven melody, it was still quite likely, quite quickly. But we cheated, a bit. We assumed that all notes are the same length. What happens to the odds when we include two possible durations for each note?","graphic":"probability","type":"duration"},{"text":"That escalated quickly! We ran this one too, it took <span class=beethoven2-attempts></span> attempts to get it right.
